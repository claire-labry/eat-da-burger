# BURGERZ

BURGERZ is an app that allows a user to insert a burger favorite and have the option to devour it. 

This app is a simple full-stack product that incorporates front- end with the back-end. There are three burgers that were fed into mySQL that allowed the demonstration of the burgers appearing on the app. In order to construct this app, HTML and CSS were used with the foundational help of Handlebars as a templating language.

# How to Use

FRONT END: Users can insert a burger and have the option to click 'Devour It!' and once clicked, the burger will appear under the 'Devoured Burgers' section. The burgers data is being actively tracked through mySQL database. 

BACK END: Users can git clone the repo and npm install the node packages and run the node server locally. This result will create the PORT link for the user to use.
